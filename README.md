# ShrinkMP3
This is a script to shrink the size of your MP3 file from a directory to another directory by removing to old ones.
So to prevent lost of your original files, make sure you already backup them.

It works well on Mac OSX because I created it to use for my own case.
If you would like to update this script for more use cases, pull request is always welcomed.


It mainly uses ffmpeg library to perform main action.

## How to use:
To use it, first change directory to this script.
* ``./shrinkmp3.sh [Original MP3 direcotry] [New empty directory]``
